    <h1 class="title">Dane County Evictions: A Hidden Phenomenon</h1>
    <p class="paragraph">Below is a map of the distribution of one or more evictions by block groups within Dane County,
        Wisconsin. Multiple evictions are defined as more than one eviction that has been issued to the same person or
        household. On this map, multiple eviction filings are separated into three different classes. These classes
        include 2 to 3 multiple evictions, 4 to 9 multiple evictions, and 10 or more multiple evictions. Single eviction
        filings for an individual or houehold are also present on the map.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph"> Multiple evictions are an important indicator of housing displacement, particularly a type of displacement
        called chain displacement. Chain displacement is the phenomenon in which displacement happens in a neighborhood
        not undergoing gentrification, meaning that there is no significant change in residentsâ€™ or neighborhood
        characteristics. It usually occurs at a point where there is not much evidence of physical decline of the
        property or when rent is first increased, and almost always the neighborhood has a high poverty level. This
        makes tenants vulnerable to exploitative evictions based on race, gender, socioeconomic status, and other
        factors (Sims & Iverson, 2021). In recent years, chain displacement in Dane County has been studied by
        scholars Revel Sims and Alicia Iverson at the University of Wisconsin-Madison which has brought attention to an
        alarming yet seemingly invincible phenomenon. </p>
